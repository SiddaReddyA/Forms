    <p class="siddu">The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is the youth wing of the Indian Armed Forces with its headquarters in New Delhi, India. It is open to school and college students on voluntary basis as a Tri-Services Organisation, comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, engaged in developing the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The soldier youth foundation in India is a voluntary organization which recruits cadets from high schools, higher secondary, colleges and universities all over India. The cadets are given basic military training in small arms and drill. The officers and cadets have no liability for active military service once they complete their course.

        The emblem of the NCC consists of 3 colours; red, dark blue and light blue. These colours represent the Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force respectively. The 17 lotuses indicate the 17 directorates</p>
    <h2 class="c">Motto and Aim</h2>
    <p class="d">"The discussion for the motto of NCC was started in 11th central advisory meeting (CAC) held on 11 August 1978. At that time there were many mottos in mind like "Duty and wisdom"; "Duty, Unity and Discipline"; "Duty and Unity"; "Unity and Discipline". Later, at the 12th CAC meeting on 12 Oct 1980 they selected and declared "Unity and Discipline" as the motto for the NCC.[6] In living up to its motto, the NCC strives to be and is one of the greatest cohesive forces of the nation, bringing together the youth hailing from different parts of the country and molding them into united and disciplined citizens of the nation".
