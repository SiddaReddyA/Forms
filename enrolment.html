    <li>The applications submitted by the institutions are scrutinized by the Unit and feasibility of raising NCC in the institution is also examined. On fulfillment of the conditions, the application is forwarded to Gp HQ for their recommendations. Gp HQ forwards the application to Dte with their recommendations endorsed on the relevant para of the application.</li>
    <li>At Directorate level, in case of the State Govt aided institutions, the applications are forwarded to the State Govt for their commitment for bearing their share of the financial implications. Endorsement of the competent authority at para 16 of the applications is required in case of new raisings of NCC sub units. However, in case of withdrawal of NCC sub unit from one institution and it’s re allotment to another one, the endorsement of the State Govt is not mandatory. If no response is received from the State Govt within 30 days , it is presumed that the State Govt has no objection to the proposal of the withdrawal/ re allotment.</li>

    <li>Once the commitment to bear the financial implications is endorsed and the cadet strength becomes available, the Dte forwards the applications to NCC HQ for sanction of the raising.</li>
    <li>This HQ scrutinizes the applications on the basis of criterion of waiting list seniority, endorsement for financial commitment for the State Govt / sponsor share, availability of cadet str etc, and on being found eligible, sanction is accorded and communicated to the Dte.</li>
    <li>The Dte, in turn, communicates the sanction to concerned Gp HQ who in turn communicates to the Unit and after that the process of raising starts.</li>
    <li>Dte can recommend out of turn sanction for prestigious institutions.</li></ol>
